# Async Week Project

Link to the project video: TBD

## Description

This is a small project playing around with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) : )

### Motivation

I first got my interest in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) when I saw Bruno Simon's [personal website](https://bruno-simon.com/), which was made using this library. It is really powerful & fun when web browser become so interactive in a 3D context! So, why not try it myself! + w +

### Technology

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a JavaScript library that helps create & render animated 3D graphics in a web browser through WebGL.

## How to run this project

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start-dev` to start the build process and server
3. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you should see a green 3D cube rotating in the browser : )
